- Job Management: Data table for admins to create, edit, delete, and view applications for jobs.
- Candidate Management: Data table with advanced filtering for admins to view profiles, shortlist, or contact candidates.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4F46E5) to convey trust and professionalism, reflecting the formal aspects of recruitment. For a user-friendly touch, consider lighter shades of indigo or complementary hues.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), nearly indistinguishable from white, for a clean and modern interface. To enhance user experience, ensure sufficient contrast between the background and text.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), analogous to indigo, will add contrast for calls to action and highlights, giving the UI vibrancy. Experiment with brighter shades of teal to draw user attention.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a balance of modern aesthetics and readability. Ensure font sizes are easily legible across various screen sizes.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use Lucide React icons for a consistent and modern look across the application. Icons should be intuitive and easily recognizable.
- Employ glass-morphism inspired cards and headers with subtle gradients for a modern, fancy design. Be mindful of accessibility when using glass-morphism to maintain readability.
- Integrate Framer Motion for smooth page transitions, hover effects, and modal animations, enhancing the user experience. Animations should be subtle and not detract from the user's task.
